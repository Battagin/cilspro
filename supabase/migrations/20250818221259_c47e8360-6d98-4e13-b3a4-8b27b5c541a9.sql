-- Document the final security model and verify it's working correctly
-- The current configuration should be secure - let's verify

-- Check that our score-exercise edge function can still access answer keys
-- (This uses service_role internally so it should work)

-- Add comprehensive documentation about the security model
COMMENT ON TABLE public.demo_exercises IS 
'SECURITY MODEL: Contains exercise answer keys - RESTRICTED ACCESS ONLY
- RESTRICTIVE policy blocks ALL user access (authenticated + anonymous)
- PERMISSIVE policy allows ONLY service_role (edge functions) access
- Users access safe content via demo_exercises_public view
- Answer validation happens server-side via score-exercise function';
